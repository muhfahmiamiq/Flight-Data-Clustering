# Flight Data Clustering

## 1. Business Problem

The airline industry faces numerous challenges in customer retention, personalized marketing, and service optimization. Understanding customer behavior and preferences is crucial to tailor services, enhance loyalty programs, and optimize routes and schedules. Clustering this customer dataset can aid in identifying distinct customer segments based on their behaviors, preferences, and value to the airline.

## 2. Solution Strategy

My approach revolves around employing clustering techniques to gain insights into customer behavior within the airline industry. By leveraging clustering algorithms, the aim is to segment customers into distinct groups based on similarities in their travel patterns, preferences, loyalty engagement, or other pertinent attributes.
1. EDA: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves using descriptive statistics and both univariate and multivariate analysis methods to understand the dataset's attributes, intending to explore and grasp its nature.
2. Data Preprocessing: Selecting features for clustering in a business context, it's essential to consider attributes that align with the business objectives or could potentially reveal valuable insights. Preparing raw data for machine learning models involves a crucial stage known as data preprocessing. This phase encompasses various activities focused on cleaning, transforming, and structuring the data to render it appropriate for analysis or modeling purposes.
3. Modelling & Evaluation: Modeling and evaluating data using K-means clustering involves initially determining the best number of clusters through methods like the elbow technique or silhouette scores. Once the optimal cluster count is identified, visualization techniques, like scatter plots, help interpret the resulting clusters, while silhouette scores quantify the quality of clustering, ensuring a robust analysis and pattern recognition.
4. Model interpretation + Recommendations: Interpreting clusters in a business context involves grasping their unique traits for targeted strategies. By understanding these clusters, tailored recommendations can optimize services or marketing efforts, aligning business actions with the specific needs and behaviors identified within each group.
